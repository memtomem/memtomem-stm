"""Tiny stdio MCP server used by integration tests.

Stands in for `memtomem-server` so that STM's McpClientSearchAdapter can be
exercised end-to-end without depending on a real memtomem installation. It
exposes the two tools the adapter actually calls — ``mem_search`` and the
``mem_do`` meta-tool routing the ``scratch_get`` action — both returning
canned text in the format the adapter knows how to parse.

Run with: `python <path-to-this-file>`
